# last-letter-bot
Repo for the Last Letter Discord Bot - originally made to replace a similar bot in one server locally. The bot was hosted on Heroku while their free service was still available.

Critical files like `token.pkl` are not uploaded, and other dataframe files are not fully initialised as I don't currently intend to deploy the bot again. This repo is here for showcasing, archiving, and to note down possible improvements to the program (of which there's admittedly a lot), in case I want to pick it up again.
